⚙️ How It Works

You speak → SpeechRecognition converts your voice to text.

The text is sent to the Gemini API (main() function).

Gemini generates a reply → The assistant speaks it back using SpeechSynthesis.

Once it finishes talking → it automatically starts listening again.

It’s a continuous talk–think–reply loop — smooth, natural, and futuristic.
